A content inventory is a list of all of your content, such as pages, news releases, blog posts, documents, etc.

To truly understand your content and how to improve it for residents, you must assess each piece of content.

A content inventory we'll help your department discover:
* what content is currently on your site
* pageviews and other data for your content
* what content is out of date or no longer relevant
* how the content could be reorganized to improve clarity
