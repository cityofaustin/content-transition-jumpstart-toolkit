### What is content?
This includes web pages, images, audio and video files, interactive elements, documents--all information assets on a website. To get a full view of what is already on a website, everything needs to be cataloged. 

### What is a content inventory?
A content inventory answers the question of: “What is there?” It is the cataloging of all of the content on a website and can be the start of a website review.
